## AssertSpecFinder

### To run project:
1) Clone the project you want to run the tool on to the projects repo.
2) Run the assertspecfinder main method with whatever params you want from your IDE (I use PyCharm). Or run the job 
from the command line. If running from command line, use python assertspecfinder.py <project_name>.
3) You shouldn't need any dependencies for the assertspecfinder job.
