## Instrumentor & Runner

### To run project:
1) Locate the assertions.csv from the assertspecfinder
2) Adjust the main code in instrumentor.py to reflect the project name (you must
create this project name folder locally, where the output log txt files will
be written to), assertion csv path, base directory (route from which assertion csv file path
entries would find the correct real file).
3) Run the code from the terminal or pycharm, etc.
