*LLMs were used more considerably for this task than the prior. This is because
this task is a little simpler logic-wise, so I found that much of the LLM-generated
code was satisfactory based on the goals for this task #3. Note that this is in part
because I relaxed some of the scope paranoia from the previous task: given that we
only had to run this on about 10 tests per projects, we can just look at top-level tests.
